# ExamGPT

ExamGPT helps users prepare for their exams by automatically generating flashcards and multiple-choice questions from their study materials (eg. PDF files). Studying techniques like [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) and [Retreival learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/using-retrieval-practice-to-increase-student-learning/) are common among students and creating high quality flash cards is a key component of these learning methods. There are software solutions like Anki and Quizlet that let students use flash cards effectively, but creating these flash cards is a time consuming process. This project attempts to solve that problem using AI.

In ExamGPT, users goto a website and upload the their study material and get an exam code. Once ExamGPT is done processing the study material, the user is ready for practicing for their exam. The user can download [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) and practice using flashcards and multiple choice questions (MCQs) using their exam code and the ExamGPT telegram bot.

This version of ExamGPT works only on local compute (eg your laptop). For a cloud version of this project, please check: https://github.com/rajkorde/ExamGPTCloud
